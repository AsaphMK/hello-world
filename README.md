# hello-world
my first repository

I think I love programming. Although it is not what I studied in campus, I was intrigued by the possibility of
earning income as a mobile developer. However, I believe that I'll unearth my passion in programming by viewing
the income earning potential as a secondary benefit. Money follows passion. Based on this, I'll need to have a 
greater passion for programming and I know money will follow later.
